# CORE_JAVA
This is my learning log for Core Java.

I’m going through the basics step by step—writing code to understand concepts like classes, inheritance, exceptions, collections, and how things actually work under the hood. Every file here is something I wrote to test, break, fix, and finally get.

It’s not polished. It’s not a tutorial. It’s just me figuring things out, one small program at a time.

If you’re on a similar path, maybe you’ll find something useful. And if you’ve been through this already—feel free to point out what I’ve missed. I’m all ears.

Thanks for stopping by.
